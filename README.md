# Espacio VIP App | In Progress | 2025

Espacio VIP App is a desktop application developed to manage basic accounting workflows for a small carpentry business.

The application was created to replace manual Excel-based processes that were becoming inefficient and error-prone, providing a clearer and more structured way to track invoices, payments and client information.

This project was built and used internally to simplify daily operations.
